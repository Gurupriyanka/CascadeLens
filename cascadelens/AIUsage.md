# AI usage log

How AI tools were used to build CascadeLens. Update this as you go: paste real prompts, note what was produced, and record what you kept or changed.

## Tools used

- Claude (planning, design review, prompt drafting)
- OpenAI API (runtime: the Analyst and Reporter agents)
- GitHub Codespaces and Copilot, if used

## 1. Problem definition

- Used Claude to compare project ideas (Smart Backlog Assistant, PR review, ingestion failure triage) and chose failure triage because it fits my data engineering background.
- Refined the scope with Claude: three layers (ingestion, curation, semantic), lineage matching on source and target table names, a per-pipeline status board.
- What I changed or rejected: TODO (example: dropped the stakeholder message in favor of a status board).

## 2. Solution design

- Used Claude to review the architecture: Python for deterministic facts, LLM agents for judgment and writing.
- Output design reduced from many outputs to three sections: status board, incidents, needs review.
- Agent design trimmed from many tools to a small set of Analyst tools.
- What I changed or rejected: TODO.

## 3. Implementation

| Date | Tool | Prompt (short) | What it produced | Kept or changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TODO | | | | |

## 4. Prompt iterations (runtime prompts)

| Version | Change | Why | Result on scenarios |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | TODO | | |
| v2 | TODO | | |

## 5. Testing and debugging with AI

TODO: bugs found, how AI helped, what you verified yourself.

## 6. Reflection on AI use

TODO: where AI saved time, where it was wrong, how you checked its output.
